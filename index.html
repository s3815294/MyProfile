              I was and bought up in India. I speak Hindi and English and know a
              little bit of french too. An interesting fact about myself is that
              at first, I find hard to bond with people but after that I connect
              with them really well, this is because of exposure I got from the
              past two years when I came to Australia for my studies. I
              Currently work at McDonald's as a Crew Trainer, where I train new
              crew and work in a friendly environment.

            <section>
              <h3>My Interests and how it all started!</h3>
              <p>
                During my childhood I was always interested in computers and
                stuff. I used to have a Computer in my room for playing games
                and stuff. One day in school we were taught about MS-Excel which
                at first I found really boring but one day My mom was
                calculating her staff's salary in which she was struggling so I
                helped her using some Excel formulas which I leared in the
                school. That made her work done in seconds and she was quite
                impressed with that. From that time she used to call me whenever
                she needed some help. That moment made me explore that by using
                a computer, in what ways I can help her. That was the point
                which made me more curious into IT stuff and from then I always
                have a hunger to learn more and more.
              </p>
              <p>
                I always wanted to study aboard, I used to see in movies that
                how interesting and different it is from my home country so then
                was the time I asked my parents if I can study abroad. My
                parents were very much in support with this as they knew how
                much I started to like IT.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started my research for International Universities around the
                globe but also had to keep in mind about accomodation. My Aunt
                lives here in Australia so it was an easy choice to choose
                Australia for studies. After seeing the quality of education
                given by RMIT. I instantly made my mind that I will be chosing
                RMIT for my future studies.

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>My ideal Job is a Data/Business Analyst.</p>

            <p>
              A Data/Business Analyst is a person who bridges the gap between IT
              and the business using data analytics to assess processes,
              determine requirements and deliver data-driven recommendations and
              reports to executives and stakeholders.
            </p>

            <h3>What makes this job Appealing to me?</h3>
            <p>
              I’ve always been deeply interested in numbers and thinking
              differently to find better ways of doing things.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I started helping my mother, I always got curious if I can do
              a similar thing with a different way. So Thats the reason this Job
              excites me because with a big company I would get a chance to do
              similar things I have tried before in a better way using latest
              technology. Also I would be getting a chance to learn something
              new in a feild I always wanted to work.
            </p>

            <h3>Skills Required</h3>

            <p>
              A Data/Business Analyst requires a bunch of Technical skills as
              well as soft skills.

          <p>
            Landing first job though requires some experience too, but not much.
            I am planning to get some by Internships and graduate programs which
            I can do along with my studies, so I am job ready till the time I
            graduate.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently I believe throughout my studies I have developed some
            Technical skills like Python, SQL and Tableau. Also doing group
            projects and working part time here has helped me improved my
            communication skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the coming years I would definately develop my Technical
            skills in University along with attending some bootcamps, and make
            side projects. I will also try to read books to improve on my
            speaking by reading books and trying to hang out with people with
            differnt nationality.

          The three tests I did were, first an online Myers-Briggs test at
          www.16personalities.com, secondly an online learning style test at
          www.educationplanner.org ,lastly it was a creativity test at
          www.testmycreativity.com
        </p>

        <p>The Results of the following were:</p>

        <div class="container">
          <div class="test1">
            <img src="img/Test_1.png" alt="" />
          </div>

          <div class="test2">
            <img src="img/Test_2.png" alt="" />
          </div>

          <div class="test3">
            <img src="img/Test_3.png" alt="" />
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          After viewing my results, I feel like I understand myself a lot more
          now. As an ENTJ, I found out that I am more future driven, I like
          planning and the results really reflect who I am because following out
          my plans give me a sense of achievement. I strive for greatness, when
          given the right resources and opportunities, I will be able to achieve
          what I plan and that makes me feel fulfilled. As an ENTJ, my weakness
          is that I can be critical and blunt when it comes to achieving my
          goal. This quiz has helped me realise this about myself and now that
          I’m more aware I will do more to reflect on my interactions with
          others. As an auditory learner like the results claim, I came to
          realise how much better I learn when hearing people explain it rather
          than just reading instructions off a paper. It also claims I am a
          tactile learner as much as I am an auditory learner, this means to me
          that I learn better when I am being shown to do something because that
          makes more sense to me. Having a creativity score of 67.69, creativity
          is not my strongest but it is not my weakest trait. Through the
          creativity score, I am able to see the areas of creativity that I am
          strongest in which are boldness, complexity and paradox and which
          areas I’m not so strong in connection and abstraction. These quizzes
          really helped me to understand more about myself and who I am and due
          to that I am able to explore and reflect on my ideals and what drives
          me.
        </p>

        <p>
          These results influence how I will act in a team since based on the
          16personalities, I am a natural born leader, I have the extraverted
          nature to want to have the initiative and take charge. With my people
          skills I plan to draw everyone towards a common understanding and get
          the work done. Being able to stay committed to the plan, I will do my
          best in the team to help everyone stay on track. I love a good
          challenge, as a team we are going to face some setbacks, I plan to
          challenge that head on and help motivate my team to do the same. My
          ability to hold long term focus will be an asset to the team because
          even if some things don’t go as planned I know that in the end if I am
          still able to achieve what I wanted from the start it won’t make a
          difference. This determination will help bring out the best in my
          teammates because when they want to give up, they will want to keep
          persisting and together we will be able to succeed. My learning style
          being auditory focused, I will hear out my teammates opinions and
          views on the matter and incorporate that into our projects so that
          everyone feels fulfilled and contributed. And also because I am an
          auditory/tactile person, I’ll be able to relate to other people like
          me and show what I mean by demonstrating and talking it out in real
          time so that the learner can see and hear what I mean. In a group, I
          plan to contribute in the creative aspect through my boldness. I am
          willing to take risks and drive to constantly improve till I get the
          results I want. The group can benefit from this because it would be a
          waste of a good idea if it doesn’t get implemented or scrapped aside
          because no one in the group has the confidence to pull it through.
        </p>
        These results would aid in guiding me to pick people in the team that
        would help compliment or challenge me. As an ENTJ, one of my personal
        values includes learning so for my team I’d pick people who can help me
        in the areas I am lacking in so that way they can help me grow in those
        areas. A good challenge is also very important so people that keep me
        intellectually engaged would be a great addition for my team. When
        forming a team it’s good to have like minded people so as long as we all
        have a common goal, we’ll be able to stay united and thus get work done.
        As a auditory/tactile learner I am a good listener and learn better when
        people talk it out so communication is key when looking out for team
        mates to build on my communication skills and be able to consult with me
        any problems they might or are facing in regards to the work so we can
        work together as a team to achieve what we want. In terms of creativity,
        I can really get some help to enhance my skills so someone who can bring
        a lot of innovative ideas to the table will help me to grow and get
        inspired which would be perfect for a teammate.

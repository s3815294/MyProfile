            <p>
              I was and bought up in India. I speak Hindi and English and know a
              little bit of french too. An interesting fact about myself is that
              at first, I find hard to bond with people but after that I connect
              with them really well, this is because of exposure I got from the
              past two years when I came to Australia for my studies.

              <h3>My Interests and how it all started!</h3>
              <p>
                During my childhood I was always interested in computers and
                stuff. I used to have a Computer in my room for playing games
                and stuff. One day in school we were taught about MS-Excel which
                at first I found really boring but one day My mom was
                calculating her staff's salary in which she was struggling so I
                helped her using some Excel formulas which I leared in the
                school. That made her work done in seconds and she was quite
                impressed with that. From that time she used to call me whenever
                she needed some help. That moment made me explore that by using
                a computer, in what ways I can help her. That was the point
                which made me more curious into IT stuff and from then I always
                have a hunger to learn more and more.
              </p>
              <p>
                I always wanted to study aboard, I used to see in movies that
                how interesting and different it is from my home country so then
                was the time I asked my parents if I can study abroad. My
                parents were very much in support with this as they knew how
                much I started to like IT.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started my research for International Universities around the
                globe but also had to keep in mind about accomodation. My Aunt
                lives here in Australia so it was an easy choice to choose
                Australia for studies. After seeing the quality of education
                given by RMIT. I instantly made my mind that I will be chosing
                RMIT for my future studies.

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>My ideal Job is a Data/Business Analyst.</p>
            
            <p>
              A Data/Business Analyst is a person who bridges the gap between IT
              and the business using data analytics to assess processes,
              determine requirements and deliver data-driven recommendations and
              reports to executives and stakeholders.
            </p>

            <h3>What makes me this job Appealing?</h3>
            <p>
              Iâ€™ve always been deeply interested in numbers and thinking
              differently to find better ways of doing things.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I started helping my mother, I always got curious if I can do
              a similar thing with a different way. So Thats the reason this Job
              excites me because with a big company I would get a chance to do
              similar things I have tried before in a better way using latest
              technology. Also I would be getting a chance to learn something
              new in a feild I always wanted to work.
            </p>

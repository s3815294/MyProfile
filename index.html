              I was and bought up in India. I speak Hindi and English and know a
              little bit of French too. An interesting fact about myself is that
              at first, I find hard to bond with people but after that I connect
              with them really well, this is because of exposure I got from the
              past two years when I came to Australia for my studies. I
              Currently work at McDonald's as a Crew Trainer, where I train new
              crew and work in a friendly environment.

              <h3>My Interests and how it all started!</h3>
              <p>
                During my childhood I was always interested in computers and
                stuff. I used to have a Computer in my room for playing games
                and stuff. One day in school we were taught about MS-Excel which
                at first I found really boring but one day My mom was
                calculating her staff's salary in which she was struggling so I
                helped her using some Excel formulas which I leared in the
                school. That made her work done in seconds and she was quite
                impressed with that. From that time she used to call me whenever
                she needed some help. That moment made me explore that by using
                a computer, in what ways I can help her. That was the point
                which made me more curious into IT stuff and from then I always
                have a hunger to learn more and more.
              </p>
              <p>
                I always wanted to study aboard, I used to see in movies that
                how interesting and different it is from my home country so then
                was the time I asked my parents if I can study abroad. My
                parents were very much in support with this as they knew how
                much I started to like IT.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started my research for International Universities around the
                globe but also had to keep in mind about accommodation. My Aunt
                lives here in Australia so it was an easy choice to choose
                Australia for studies. After seeing the quality of education
                given by RMIT. I instantly made my mind that I will be choosing 
                RMIT for my future studies.

            <p>My ideal Job is a Data/Business Analyst.</p>
            <div class="des">
              <p>
                A Data/Business Analyst is a person who bridges the gap between
                IT and the business using data analytics to assess processes,
                determine requirements and deliver data-driven recommendations
                and reports to executives and stakeholders.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h3>What makes this job Appealing to me?</h3>
            <p>
              Iâ€™ve always been deeply interested in numbers and thinking
              differently to find better ways of doing things.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I started helping my mother, I always got curious if I can do
              a similar thing with a different way. So Thats the reason this Job
              excites me because with a big company I would get a chance to do
              similar things I have tried before in a better way using latest
              technology. Also I would be getting a chance to learn something
              new in a feild I always wanted to work.
            </p>

            <h3>Skills Required</h3>

            <p>
              A Data/Business Analyst requires a bunch of Technical skills as
              well as soft skills.

            Landing first job though requires some experience too, but not much.
            I am planning to get some by Internships and graduate programs which
            I can do along with my studies, so I am job ready till the time I
            graduate.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently I believe throughout my studies I have developed some
            Technical skills like Python, SQL and Tableau. Also doing group
            projects and working part time here has helped me improved my
            communication skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the coming years I would definitely develop my Technical
            skills in University along with attending some bootcamps, and make
            side projects. I will also try to read books to improve on my
            speaking by reading books and trying to hang out with people with
            different nationality.

          The three tests I did were, first an online Myers-Briggs test at
          www.16personalities.com, secondly an online learning style test at
          www.educationplanner.org ,lastly it was a creativity test at
          www.testmycreativity.com
        </p>
      
        <p>The Results of the following were:</p>

        <div class="container">
          <div class="test1">
            <img src="img/Test_1.png" alt="" />

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          After viewing my results, I feel like I understand myself a lot more
          now. As an ENTJ, I found out that I am more future driven, I like
          planning and the results really reflect who I am because following out
          my plans give me a sense of achievement. I strive for greatness, when
          given the right resources and opportunities, I will be able to achieve
          what I plan and that makes me feel fulfilled. As an ENTJ, my weakness
          is that I can be critical and blunt when it comes to achieving my
          goal. This quiz has helped me realise this about myself and now that
          Iâ€™m more aware I will do more to reflect on my interactions with
          others. As an auditory learner like the results claim, I came to
          realise how much better I learn when hearing people explain it rather
          than just reading instructions off a paper. It also claims I am a
          tactile learner as much as I am an auditory learner, this means to me
          that I learn better when I am being shown to do something because that
          makes more sense to me. Having a creativity score of 67.69, creativity
          is not my strongest but it is not my weakest trait. Through the
          creativity score, I am able to see the areas of creativity that I am
          strongest in which are boldness, complexity and paradox and which
          areas Iâ€™m not so strong in connection and abstraction. These quizzes
          really helped me to understand more about myself and who I am and due
          to that I am able to explore and reflect on my ideals and what drives
          me.
        </p>

        <p>
          These results influence how I will act in a team since based on the
          16personalities, I am a natural born leader, I have the extraverted
          nature to want to have the initiative and take charge. With my people
          skills I plan to draw everyone towards a common understanding and get
          the work done. Being able to stay committed to the plan, I will do my
          best in the team to help everyone stay on track. I love a good
          challenge, as a team we are going to face some setbacks, I plan to
          challenge that head on and help motivate my team to do the same. My
          ability to hold long term focus will be an asset to the team because
          even if some things donâ€™t go as planned I know that in the end if I am
          still able to achieve what I wanted from the start it wonâ€™t make a
          difference. This determination will help bring out the best in my
          teammates because when they want to give up, they will want to keep
          persisting and together we will be able to succeed. My learning style
          being auditory focused, I will hear out my teammates opinions and
          views on the matter and incorporate that into our projects so that
          everyone feels fulfilled and contributed. And also because I am an
          auditory/tactile person, Iâ€™ll be able to relate to other people like
          me and show what I mean by demonstrating and talking it out in real
          time so that the learner can see and hear what I mean. In a group, I
          plan to contribute in the creative aspect through my boldness. I am
          willing to take risks and drive to constantly improve till I get the
          results I want. The group can benefit from this because it would be a
          waste of a good idea if it doesnâ€™t get implemented or scrapped aside
          because no one in the group has the confidence to pull it through.
        </p>
        These results would aid in guiding me to pick people in the team that
        would help compliment or challenge me. As an ENTJ, one of my personal
        values includes learning so for my team Iâ€™d pick people who can help me
        in the areas I am lacking in so that way they can help me grow in those
        areas. A good challenge is also very important so people that keep me
        intellectually engaged would be a great addition for my team. When
        forming a team itâ€™s good to have like minded people so as long as we all
        have a common goal, weâ€™ll be able to stay united and thus get work done.
        As a auditory/tactile learner I am a good listener and learn better when
        people talk it out so communication is key when looking out for team
        mates to build on my communication skills and be able to consult with me
        any problems they might or are facing in regards to the work so we can
        work together as a team to achieve what we want. In terms of creativity,
        I can really get some help to enhance my skills so someone who can bring
        a lot of innovative ideas to the table will help me to grow and get
        inspired which would be perfect for a teammate.

      <h2>Project Idea</h2>

      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>
        Waste is very closely related to human life. Where there are humans,
        there must be waste. Humans will produce trash or waste in every
        activity. There are two categories of waste, namely wet (organic) and
        dry (inorganic) waste. Wet waste (organic) in the form of plant
        residues, animals or dirt that can be decomposed by microorganisms and
        can rot, while dry (inorganic) waste is very difficult to decompose
        because it contains plastic or glass. We will be working on a machine
        which will automatically separate disposable waste, green waste and
        recyclable waste and will help to have green environment for future.
        We will work on how we can make an automatic garbage sorting machine
        with Arduino.
      </p>

      <div class="motivation">
        <h3>Motivation</h3>

        <p>
          Back in my hometown India due to the lack of education in most rural
          area waste is a major issue. People just dump waste into their
          dustbins and the people who come home to collect waste, collect it
          all together and dump into a ground. Waste over there is kept there
          was days. Bees and mosquitos surround near them and then those bees
          and mosquitos go into our house and spread diseases. So having an
          Arduino based garbage sorting machine would benefit billions of
          Indians living in rural areas and the environment near them.

          Arduino can connect different sensors which can be easily used in
          this project like Inductive Sensor, Capacitive Sensor, Ultrasonic
          Sensors.
        </p>

        <p>
          A sensor or transducer is a gadget that can answer a deliberate
          article and convert it into a perceptible sign. The sensor is a
          gadget that can change over non-electrical signs into electrical
          signs. Sensors utilized in this exploration are ultrasonic sensors,
          capacitive nearness sensors and inductive closeness sensors.
          Fundamentally, ultrasonic sensors are utilized to quantify the
          distance between object deterrents and sensors. The ultrasonic
          sensor comprises of a transmitter and collector. The transmitter
          conveys a message in one heading and the communicated signal is then
          reflected at whatever point there are obstructions and is gotten by
          the receiver. Ultrasonic sensor applies the guideline of TOF (Time
          of Flight) to quantify the distance, in a question of season of the
          target. Therefore, the exhibition of ultrasonic sensors is extremely
          reliant upon the intelligent attributes, for instance the shape,
          surface material of the objective surface. Ultrasonic sensor is
          utilized to recognize whether there are individuals close to the
          waste receptacle by estimating a distance of around 10-20 cm, in the
          event that any, the servo engine will work and the top of the waste
          canister will open naturally. Ultrasonic sensor is additionally used
          to gauge the degree of totality of the waste.
        </p>

        <div class="d">
          <p>
            Closeness sensor, in everyday serves for contactless location of
            different articles, regardless of whether metal, before the
            compelling region of the sensor. There are three fundamental sorts
            of nearness sensors, to be specific inductive, capacitive and
            attractive. In this examination inductive nearness sensor is
            utilized to distinguish metal items and closeness capacitive
            sensor is utilized to recognize objects with low dielectric
            materials, for example, plastic or glass and higher dielectric
            materials like fluids. This sensor can identify the objective in
            view of the permittivity esteem. Basically, an inductive nearness
            sensor with a capacitive closeness sensor looks similar. The thing
            that matters is that inductive nearness sensors produce
            electromagnetic fields, while capacitive closeness sensors produce
            electrostatic fields.

        <h3>Tools and technologies</h3>

        <p>
          We are using Arduino as a hardware here. Arduino is an open-source
          gadgets stage in view of simple to-utilize equipment and
          programming. Arduino sheets can understand inputs - light on a
          sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and transform
          it into a result - initiating an engine, turning on a LED,
          distributing something on the web. You can guide your board by
          sending a bunch of guidelines to the microcontroller on the board.
          To do as such you utilize the Arduino programming language, and the
          Arduino Software (IDE), in light of Processing.

        <h3>Skills</h3>

        <p>
          The basic skills required to operate an Arduino are programming and
          basic electronics. It uses C++ similar language so a person familiar
          with C++ will be able to operate it easily.

        <h3>Outcome</h3>

        <p>
          There can be two different outcomes on it, if these are installed in
          houses, the waste will already be separated and can be taken out on
          different days. On the other hand, if it is installed in dumping
          ground which can sort the garbage at the end. This may require a
          huge garbage sorter which will increase a lot of production cost,
          and which might be not possible to produce.

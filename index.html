					<h2>Introduction</h2>
				</header>
				<p>I was and bought up in India. I speak Hindi and English and know a little bit of french too. An interesting fact about myself is that at first, 
					I find hard to bond with people but after that I connect with them really well. 
					I also have a pet dog which I havenâ€™t met for the last 2 years since I came to Australia. 
					My mom was the one who used to hate dogs but now she is the one who takes care of it and loves him the most.
					 I came to Australia in 2020 to peruse my higher education and achive my dreams.</p>

					<h3>My Interests and how it all started!</h3>
					<p>During my childhood I was always interested in computers and stuff. I used to have a Computer in my room for playing games and stuff. One day in school we were taught about
						MS-Excel which at first I found really boring but one day My mom was calculating her staff's salary in which she was struggling so I helped her using some Excel formulas which I leared in the school. That made her work done in seconds and she was quite impressed with that. From that time she used to call me whenever she needed some help. That moment made me explore that by using a computer, in what ways I can help her. That was the point which made me more curious into IT stuff and from then I always have a hunger to learn more and more.
					</p>
					<p>I always wanted to study aboard, I used to see in movies that how interesting and different it is from my home country so then was the time I asked my parents if I can study abroad. My parents were very much in support with this as they knew how much I started to like IT.</p>
					<p> I started my research for International Universities around the globe but also had to keep in mind about accomodation. My Aunt lives here in Australia so it was an easy choice to choose Australia for studies. After seeing the quality of education given by RMIT. I instantly made my mind that i will be chosing RMIT for my future studies.</p>

					<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Really anything that continues to push me further...</p>
				<p>... But to answer the question I would be looking at a Business Analyst role or Security Consultant
					in the future.
					I'm very much interested in the security field and business management, so I'd hope to move into one
					of those areas and continue learning of the many different facets of IT.
					While interested in transitioning into one of those fields, I would hope to have time available to
					allow for me to stay within the education sector.</p>
